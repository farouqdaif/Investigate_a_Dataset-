# Project: (Investigate a Dataset (TMDb Movie Data))
>I choose the TMDb movie data set for data analysis. This data set contains information about5000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.I would like to find other intresting patterns in the dataset.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and the following Python libraries installed:
Python 
NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Conclusion
> Movies with higher popularity have shown a corresponding increase in the revenues.

> Warner Bros, Universal Pictures and Paramount Pictures production companies earn more life time profit than other production companies.

## Limitations
It's not 100 percent guaranteed solution that this formula is gonna work, But it shows us that we have high probability of making high popularity if we had similar characteristics as such. If we release a movie with these characteristics, it gives people high expectations from this movie. This was just one example of an influantial factor that would lead to different results, there are many that have to be taken care of.
